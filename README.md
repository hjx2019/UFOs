# UFOs
> Module 11 Challenge

## Overview of Project: 

UFO lovers need a place to find UFO records in one place with an easy way to find the detail information. Through this web page, data are easily filtered and displayed with friendly interface and interactive parameters.

## Results: 

When the page is loaded, scroll down to filter boxes.

On the right, we can find all the historical record about UFO events. We can filter the table by the attributes in the boxes on the left. For example, you can put 1/11/2010, and click somewhere else and the table will be refreshed according to the date 1/11/2010. The same filter funtion works when you neeed to filter by city/ country/ shape ,etc.

## Summary: 

> The webpage is completed according to the requests. However, we have further chances to optimize it. 

* the first point is that the filtered boxes can be dropdown lists.
* the second point is that the default value can sample values instead of total data.
